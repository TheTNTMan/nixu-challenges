In this challenge, I was asked to decode an encrypted message. 
I open the message.txt and received an encrypted text. 
First I bring to cypher identifier to analyze the code https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier 
It was a base64 code then I decrypt it and it turns into a ASCII code
I then bring it to analyze one more time and it was a ROT-13 code 
I decrypt once again and receive the message.
